## 🧩 Description

**Stasbook** is a distributed clone of Facebook developed with a microservices architecture. It includes isolated services communicating via **gRPC** and **RabbitMQ**, with core social features like authentication, posts, comments, likes, and notifications.

The system is fully containerized with **Docker**, and each service is monitored via **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, with metrics pushed from services using **Pushgateway**. This ensures observability for critical operations like queue processing, DB replication, and performance tracking.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frameworks**: Node.js, NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis (Cache & Session)
- **Transport**: gRPC, Protocol Buffers, RabbitMQ
- **ORMs**: Prisma, TypeORM, Drizzle
- **Logging**: Pino
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Pushgateway
- **Object Storage**: S3
- **Authentication**: Session-based, OAuth2 (Google/Yandex), Mail (SMTP via Mailhog)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **CRON**: Scheduled DB replication

---

## 📊 Monitoring

Observability and metrics are integral to the system's design. The following tools are used:

- **Prometheus** — scrapes metrics from each service
- **Pushgateway** — services push custom metrics (e.g., background job durations, queue size)
- **Grafana** — visualizes dashboards for system health and performance
- **Node Exporter** — optional for low-level Docker/container metrics

You can track events such as:
- RabbitMQ queue length & processing times
- gRPC request latency
- DB replication success
- Custom app metrics (e.g., post creation rate, login frequency)

All components are containerized and available in the `docker-compose.ymlEXZAMPLE`.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines

Each microservice in **Stasbook** is integrated with CI/CD pipelines for fast feedback and quality control:

- ✅ **Linting**, **unit tests**, and **build checks** run on every PR
- 🐳 Docker builds and caching ensure consistent environments
- 🧪 Test coverage reporting helps enforce code quality
- ⚙️ Future deployment pipelines (e.g., staging/production) can be integrated via GitHub Actions or other CI tools

> The pipeline is configured to validate each service individually, ensuring independence and modularity across the architecture.
